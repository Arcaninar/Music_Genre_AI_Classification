# Music Genre AI Classification

> Train AI to classify music genres using KNN & Multi-class SVM method
<hr>

In this project, AI is trained to classify music genres using 2 methods: KNN (K-Nearest Neighbour) & Multi-class SVM (Support Vector Machine). This project discusses which AI model is better, and which property should be used for the AI to be more accurate. The raw data is obtained from [GTZAN Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andradaolteanu/gtzan-dataset-music-genre-classification?select=Data).

## Project Output

* Analysis of which AI model is better for classifying music genres
* Analysis of what method could be used to increase the AI model's accuracy
* Confusion matrix & accuracy plots from both methods

## Project Contents

This project contains 1 IPython Notebook file (Music_Genre_AI_Classification.ipynb) and 1 CSV file (features_3_sec.csv).
The IPython Notebook file contains all the analysis, matrix, and plots. While the CSV file is the dataset obtained from the GTZAN Dataset (This project only uses the 3 seconds features dataset)

## How to run this project
1. Clone this project
2. Setup a Python kernel (I used [Anaconda Python kernel](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install/windows/) and the [online Jupyter Notebook](https://saturncloud.io/blog/how-to-add-a-library-in-jupyter-notebook-online/))
3. Install these Python libraries
   * [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/install.html)
   * [Numpy](https://numpy.org/install/)
   * [Sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html)
   * [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/installing/index.html)
   * [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/installing.html)
4. Open the Music_Genre_AI_Classification.ipynb file using a text editor like VSCode, or an IDE.
5. Run all the code cells on that .ipynb file

## Contributor
This is a personal project which I intend to stop here. If you want to edit this project, you can clone it to your own GitHub repository and edit it there. Thanks!

# Music Genre AI Classification

> Train AI to classify music genres using KNN & Multi-class SVM method
<hr>

In this project, AI is trained to classify music genres using 2 methods: KNN (K-Nearest Neighbour) & Multi-class SVM (Support Vector Machine). This project discusses which AI model is better, and which property should be used for the AI to be more accurate. The raw data is obtained from [GTZAN Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andradaolteanu/gtzan-dataset-music-genre-classification?select=Data).
